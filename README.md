## FAQ

### Why?

> *"I always wanted to create a successor of Freezer that could follow its footsteps, and Echo gave me a good opportunity to start with it."*

### How is FLAC/320 possible without a Premium Account?

> *"Well, I use a script, or rather a server, that gives back the premium songs. It was created by [@uhwot](https://github.com/uhwot), and I simply stumbled upon it while doing research about stuff for Deezer.*"
